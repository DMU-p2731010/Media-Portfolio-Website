<h3>Pizza Advert</h3> 

<p>For one of his first projects at De Monfort University Connor had to make a advert about anything he wanted and he choose his one great love, PIZZA! The advert at the begin seems like your normal advertisement for pizza but then take a big turn into a comedy skit to hopefully get people to eat pizza more. That was Connor's idea anyway.</p>

<h3>Running Behind Time</h3> 

<p>This very short, short film was an ice-breaker project when Connor was just starting university and it's how he met a lot of great people when shooting this video. It is about a student who is late for his class but what peop;e don't know is that he has the superpower of super-speed, but that power comes at a high cost.</p>
